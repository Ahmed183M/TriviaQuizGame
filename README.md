# Trivia Game

In this project, you will be practicing everything you learned by making a trivia game!!

## Functionality
1. This web app will be fetching the questions and data from this api: https://opentdb.com/
2. The user should pick the topic which he wants the questions to be about before starting the game.
3. After the user selects the topic, 10 questions should be asked to the user one after the other.
4. While the user answers a question, the web app should tell the user if he/she got the answer correct or not.
5. After all questions have been answered, the web app should display the score and ask if they want to play again.

## Classes
Every object in this app should be a class. For instance:

- Question
- Answers

And class related logic should be put as methods inside the respective class whether they're static methods or instance methods.
Listeners and UI updating methods can sit outside of the classes.

You don't have to follow the same design. You are free to use your other colors and be creative if you want to!

As always, please reachout to your colleagues then your instructors if you ever get stuck.

Have fun coding!!
